                                networks</span></h2>
                        <p>Some public Wi-Fi networks need a password to log in, but that doesn't automatically make
                            them
                            safe. Public networks are not secure, meaning other people can have easy access to it and
                            there’s no firewall keeping you safe from malicious entities. One danger is you might end up
                            logging on to a rogue network. This is essentially when a cybercriminal’s rogue hotspot
                            pretends
                            to be a public network, acting as a ‘middleman’ between you and the real network. This
                            allows
                            them to see all online traffic and even credentials you use.</p>

                        <p>VPNs are a popular cybersecurity tool. While employees may use their own VPNs, some might
                            skimp
                            on it and go for the cheaper or even free ones. There are even fake VPNs out there that
                            might

                            just the employees’. Confidential data and important files can be sent and accessed safely.
                            Aside from security encryption, VPNs act as a proxy to the internet.</p>

                        <p>Home office routers already have default firewalls that keep intruders and third parties from
                            infiltrating your personal gadgets. However, attackers have figured out how to hack them.

                            concerns for businesses and commercial establishments everywhere. In fact, in just 2020

                            are not the only targets of cyber criminals today. They are targeting educational
                            institutions with as much fervour as they’re victimizing governments, medical bodies,
                            businesses etc.</p>

                            themselves from cyber-attacks as they emerge as unlikely but very popular targets for
                            hackers. From ransomware to phishing to brute-force tactics, schools and educational
                            institutions have to now find ways to protect their sensitive data online and also prevent
                            hackers from attacking their students and their confidential information.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Cyber-Attacks Targeting the Education
                            Sector</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">There are many reasons why education is becoming a prime target
                            for cybercriminals.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Educational institutions vary in size, purpose, and stature, and
                            the motives of hackers can vary accordingly. For example, what might be a threat for
                            world-renowned Universities or Colleges, given the value placed on their data, might not be
                            an issue for local schools or school districts. So, educational institutions need to
                            evaluate their individual risks and understand what data is vulnerable to unauthorized
                            access.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">For large and globally recognized institutions, a cyber-attack
                            or <a href="https://www.cm-alliance.com/ransomware"><span>ransomware attack</span></a> can
                            have huge implications on their brand reputation that has been built over years. Such
                            educational institutions, then, need to look carefully at their cyber resilience
                            capabilities and incident response strategies.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">They’d do well by preparing for ransomware attacks in advance
                            and working towards building a solid cyber incident response plan for themselves, akin to
                            the kind of plans many cybersecurity-focused businesses are creating for themselves
                            today.&nbsp;</p>

                            attack.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">But before we discuss that in greater detail, let’s look at some
                            of the types of attacks that educational institutions are most vulnerable to today:</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Distributed Denial of Service (or DDoS) attack</strong> is a common type of attack
                            for online users and sites, including educational institutions. These attacks interfere with
                            one’s Internet connection and network, slowing down any productivity online.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Many large and reputed companies have been subject to DDOSing.
                            According to VXchnge, these are some of the<a
                                href="https://www.vxchnge.com/blog/recent-ddos-attacks-on-companies"> <span
                                    style="color: #1155cc; text-decoration: underline;">companies</span></a> that have
                            gotten hit with DDOS attacks - Amazon Web Services (February 2020), GitHub (February 2018),
                            Dyn (October 2016).</p>
                        <strong>2. Espionage </strong>is another form of attack from bad actors online. Cybercriminals
                        spy on activities done by students, teachers, and others in a school or institution and can even
                        use the espionage to bully or threaten the students or teachers. An unprotected network leaves
                        the door open for cybercriminals to steal and/or corrupt education data as
                        well.<br><br><strong>3. Data theft </strong>is when espionage is used to steal sensitive data
                        from institutions like schools, colleges, and universities. Sensitive data often includes:<br>
                        <p style="text-align: justify; padding-left: 80px;">-&nbsp; &nbsp;Student contact information
                            (i.e., address, grade level and status, etc.)&nbsp;<br>- Personal information of students,
                            teachers, etc. (i.e., social security number, credit/debit card information,
                            etc.)<br>-&nbsp; &nbsp;Grading systems, and so on.</p>
                        <p>4. Cybercriminals are most often looking for <strong><em>financial gain</em></strong>, when
                            committing theft and crime in a school or institution’s data system. They can either sell
                            sensitive information online or they can hold the educational institution ransom. They may
                            block access of the school to its own data until a ransom is paid – basically making it a <a

                                    attack</span></a><strong>.</strong></p>

                            </span></p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">Why Are Cyber-Attacks in the Education
                            Sector Escalating?</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">It’s no surprise that cyber-attacks are escalating, even in the
                            education sector. But why are educational institutions now being targeted by cybercriminals
                            more actively?</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">First, limited budgets in school systems are to blame for a lack
                            of protection against cyber-attacks. This is partially true, because protection requires
                            better and smarter technologies to combat these malicious attacks. In the absence of such
                            protection, schools become an easy target for cyber criminals.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Another factor may be the lack of technical staff in educational
                            institutions. While school staff normally consist of teachers, administration, custodians,
                            and maintenance, schools can benefit from having a tech crew to look into cyber concerns.
                        </p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Another, and more recent factor would be the reliance on
                            technology, thanks to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. With more and more people using online
                            platforms for giving and attending educational sessions, the attack canvas has increased
                            diametrically.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">Accenture reported<a

                                    volume</span></a> since the pandemic hit on a global scale. And, since schools and
                            universities began utilizing more and more technology and virtual resources during the
                            lockdowns and shutdowns, students, teachers, and administrations are left more vulnerable
                            than ever to cyber threats.</p>
                        <h2 style="text-align: justify; font-weight: normal;">What Can Be Done?</h2>
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">The good news is that schools and institutions can still protect
                            themselves from cybercriminals, even with limited budgets and resources in many cases. Here
                            are some great tips to follow:</p>
                        <p><strong>1. Train everyone in your school or institution.</strong> Ensure that everyone –
                            students, teachers, staff, etc. – knows how to spot suspicious online activity, and what to
                            do to resolve it.</p>
                        <p><span style="text-align: justify; background-color: transparent;">Educational institutions
                                can also invest in <a href="/training/cipr-cyber-incident-planning-response/"
                                    rel="noopener" target="_blank">cyber incident planning and response training</a> for
                                their IT staff at least once in a year. This can help the organisation create its own
                                effective <a href="/cyber-incident-response-plan-template" rel="noopener"
                                    target="_blank">cyber incident response plans</a>, which in turn can go a long way
                                in protecting the institution from the financial and reputational damage that comes with
                                cyber-attacks.</span></p>
                        <p><strong>2. Have an IT team install protection against ransomware, phishing attacks, and
                                DDOSes.</strong> There are many cost-effective services and one-time investments that
                            your institution can opt for to increase overall cyber resilience. With a few basic security
                            software, your computer networks and systems will be far safer and your educational
                            institution will remain protected at least from many basic cyber threats.</p>
                        <p><strong>3. Encourage students and staff to use two-step authentication.</strong> When logging
                            into school computers (or other devices), students, teachers, and other staff members should
                            need to enter not only a password, but also another level of authentication in the form of a
                            secret answer, solving a puzzle or entering a numeric code.</p>
                        <p><strong>4. Have “live fire” drills.</strong> Like regular fire drills, “live fire” drills
                            involve the administration staging a mock cyber-attack during regular school hours. This has
                            students and teachers refer to their training, as they work to resolve and respond to the
                            crisis.</p>
                        <p><span style="text-align: justify; background-color: transparent;">These drills can also be
                                relayed to everyone at school in the form of text messages, emails, etc. <br><br>For
                                those educational institutions that have a bigger budget, conducting a full-fledged <a

                                simulate a cyber-attack and force everyone to think and act the way they would if there
                                was a real cyber-attack. These tabletop exercises are also very cost-effective and help
                                the organisation test its cyber breach readiness with minimal disruption to regular
                                operations.</span></p>

                        <p style="text-align: justify;">As you can see, cyber-attacks can happen to anyone, including
                            schools and institutions. That’s why it’s important for the education sector to take into
                            consideration good cybersecurity practices, so that students, teachers, and everyone else
                            associated with the school is protected from malicious activity and the institution itself
                            is protected from harm to its bottom-line and its painstakingly-built brand reputation.</p>

                        <p>What exactly is cybersecurity and why does cyber security matter to every person and
                            company?&nbsp; We start by providing an easy to read answer in this blog, the first on many
                            on this topic of cyber and information security.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Cybersecurity broadly refers to the practice of leveraging technologies, processes and good
                            IT habits to protect an organisation's computers, networks, devices and sensitive data from
                            cyber-attacks. Today, cybersecurity awareness and resilience can no longer be an
                            after-thought for businesses. In fact, cybersecurity has largely evolved from being an IT
                            problem to a business problem for today's digital organisations.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>More than 30,000 websites are hacked each day globally and over 64% of companies worldwide
                            have experienced one or more cyber-attacks. Even on secure networks, it is estimated that at
                            least 75 records go missing every second. If you are in business and your business requires
                            the use of a computer and the internet in any way, it is extremely likely that you will
                            experience a cyber-attack at some point or the other.</p>
                        <p>In this blog, we will cover certain basic educational concepts around cybersecurity that
                            everyone should know about:</p>

                        <p>Today, it is no longer a question of “if” the business will be attacked. It’s more about
                            “when” the business is under attack. Therefore, it makes sense to understand all possible
                            cyber-attacks that could compromise your network. Also, keep in mind that the more
                            confidential information you store on the system, the more likely an attack will occur.
                            There are three categories of attacks that can take place including attacks on
                            confidentiality, integrity, and availability.&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>With attacks on confidentiality, your personal information, such as banking information, will
                            be under threat. Your information could be sold or traded to make the other person money.
                            With attacks on integrity, the sabotage of a company is involved. These are better known as
                            leaks. The cybercriminal will access sensitive information and then leak it to harm the
                            company’s reputation. With attacks on availability, the cyber-attack will block legitimate
                            users from their data until they pay a <a
                                href="/cybersecurity-blog/travelex-cyber-attack-timeline" rel="noopener"
                                target="_blank">ransom</a>. The criminal usually does not back off once the payment is
                            made, causing a host of problems.</p>
                        <p>Some of the main types of cyberattacks a business may encounter include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li aria-level="1">Social engineering: An attack that manipulates people to give away
                                information.</li>
                            <li aria-level="1">Malware: Malicious software is installed on the system which then steals
                                information or causes damage.</li>
                            <li aria-level="1">Ransomware attack: The software that takes control of a computer and asks
                                the owner for money to gain access again.</li>
                            <li aria-level="1">Advanced Persistent Threats: These happen when an unauthorised user gets
                                onto a network without detection and stays there to steal data.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>With time, security threats will become more advanced, making it important for companies to
                            stay up to date with <a href="/training/cipr-cyber-incident-planning-response/"
